class timer():
    """
    A class that acts as a timer/stopwatch.
    Can time two processes at once: 
      - An "outer" process which lasts for the whole duration of the timer.
        Starts and stops once.
      - An "inner" process which lasts for a fraction of the total duration 
        of the timer. Can be started and stopped multiple times.


    Attributes
    ----------
    outer_is_running : bool
        A record of whether the outer timer is currently running.
        
    inner_is_running : bool
        A record of whether the inner timer is currently running.
        Default value = False, until the inner timer is started.
        
    start_time : float
        The time at which the timer was constructed.
        
    end_time : float
        The time at which end_timer() was called.
        
    start_lapse_time : float
        The time at which start_timer_lapse() was most recently called.
        
    end_lapse_tme : float
        The time at which end_timer_lapse() was most recently called.

    Methods
    -------
    timer():
        Constructor for the timer object, which starts the outer timer.
        
    start_lapse():
        Starts the inner timer.
        
    end_lapse():
        Ends the inner timer.
        
    end_timer():
        Ends the outer timer.
        
    get_total_time():
        Returns the time in seconds recorded on the outer timer, 
        after it has been stopped.
        
    get_lapsed_time():
        Returns the time in seconds most recently recorded on the inner timer, 
        after a given lapse has been stopped.
        
        
    Raises
    ------
    
    RuntimeError:
        Occurs if the lapse timer is ended before it is started, 
        or started while it is already running.
        
        Additionally occurs if the recorded time of the outer/inner timer is 
        requested while it is still running.
